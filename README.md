Code used in the computation of the parameters of galaxies oberved at 21 cm.

The galaxies observed during this internship were :
NGC3600 ; IC2267 ; UGC7170 ; FGC1496 ; FGC1543 ; ESO577-038 ; FGC1731 ; NGC7741
      
      
This project use python to compute the data collected by the meridian radiotelescope of Nan√ßay (GRT).
To use it, execute the file "Computation.py".

The collumns of the file results.csv : Name ; rms [mJy] ; SNR ; VHI [km/s] ; stdVHI [km/s] ; W50 [km/s] ; W20 [km/s] ; FHI [Jy.km/s] ; stdFHI [Jy.km/s] ; d [Mpc] ; log(Lb) ; log(M*) ; log(MHI) ; log(Mbar) ; Vrot [km/s] ; log(Mtot) ; Mtot/Mbar ; %DarkMatter

This internship is made with Jean-Michel Martin and Wim van Driel.
